# Progress

This file is intentionally lightweight.

## Canonical Active Logs

- `docs/session-notes.md` for chronological implementation notes.
- `docs/design/status.md` for what is currently implemented and known issues.
- `docs/ops-runbook.md` for operational commands and procedures.

## Archived Snapshot

- `docs/archive/progress-2026-02-13.md` contains the previous long-form progress log.

## Logging Rules

- Add new engineering narrative entries to `docs/session-notes.md`.
- Update `docs/design/status.md` when runtime behavior changes.
- Avoid duplicating the same change across multiple log files.
